### **Buxus**

**Software developer \- CTO (July 2010 – December 2011\)** 

I started as a half-time developer for Buxus’ own Personal Finances Platform. I learned GWT, Continuous Integration, web scrapping and Git. Later in July 2011 I began working full-time and assumed the CTO role, as the current CEO-CTO began to focus on CEO activities. As CTO, I decided to begin research in the DevOps field in order to implement a Continuous Deployment platform, built on top of the existing Continuous Integration platform, adding functionality from AWS. Later, the Buxus team began to learn about mobile application development and built some small prototypes for an Android application. At the end of the year, Buxus, along with other startups, merged into Platanus, a software boutique.

Some of the technologies and tools I have used in those activities are the following:

* Java, JavaScript, GWT, Git, Gerrit Code Review, Jenkins, Android, Appcelerator Titanium, Spring for Android, Eclipse, Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, RDS, Route 53), RHEL, MySQL.

### **Wemul**

**Freelance software developer (November 2010 – December 2011\)** 

Wemul was a web restaurant catalog with Android and iOS applications. I led a small development team and provided the web backend, frontend and both mobile applications. It was my first full-stack project.

### **Penta Analytics S.A.**

**Software developer (October 2006 – October 2009\)** 

I started maintaining and adding functionality to a couple web applications. Then I performed several optimizations of the existent Data Mining processes. I refactored SQL code for the process and migrated the database server from MySQL to PostgreSQL. Time consumed by the data mining processes were reduced from 2 weeks to 8 hours, for the same data set (about 40 million records) and that allowed the company to cut costs on server infrastructure and at the same time serve more customers. The resulting BI database was accessed using partitioned tables, reducing dramatically the access time for queries and easing data maintenance. Later, PostgreSQL was replaced with InfoBright, a column-oriented database for BI, and processing time was reduced from 8 hours to just 30 minutes for the same data set described before. The next step was to replace the existing web applications (written in PHP) with a BI-oriented web application for querying OLAP cubes. A Mondrian server was built on top of the InfoBright backend and a GWT application was built in order to retrieve and display the data. Another development involved using a linear optimization library (CPLEX) in order to implement an in-house algorithm for logistics.

Besides development, I also researched some new technologies, such as implementing a multi-master PostgreSQL cluster using low-level file-system replication and some modifications to PostgreSQL server source code in order to give unprivileged users access about processes in order to visualize when an operator would use excess machine time executing queries. Database and web servers based on CentOS where migrated to Debian.

Some of the technologies and tools I have used in those activities are the following:

* PHP, Python, Perl, Java, C, C\#, SQL, MDX, MySQL, PostgreSQL, InfoBright, Mondrian, Apache, Tomcat, GWT, Ext GWT, CPLEX, DRBD, OCFS2, Linux.
